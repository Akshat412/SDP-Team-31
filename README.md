# SDP-Team-31
SDP23 Project for Team 31

Our goal is to make a smart biking helmet, which can sense riders’ vital signs such as heart rate, ambient temperature and humidity, and make it accessible to them while they bike. In the event of an accident, the system would send a remote alert to a registered contact, including the rider’s location.
